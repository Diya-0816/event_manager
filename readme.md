## üìö Reflection

Working on the Event Manager Company assignment helped me understand how to build and test a secure REST API using FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and JWT-based authentication. I fixed issues related to username and password validation, handled profile update edge cases, and resolved the bug shown in the instructor video. These tasks gave me practical experience with API request validation, secure login flows, and real-world debugging.

I also wrote automated tests using pytest and pushed test coverage over 90%. Creating test cases for login, profile updates, and permission checks improved my confidence in maintaining code quality. Using GitHub for issues, branches, and pull requests helped me follow proper collaboration practices. Overall, this project improved both my technical and teamwork skills.
